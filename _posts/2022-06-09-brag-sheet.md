* **Extracurriculars:** I am a member of East Brunswick FIRST Inc. We operate a robotics team representing East Brunswick known as Astraea Robotics. As a member of the non-technical subteam, I write grants and and help organize outreach events to spread STEM throughout the community. We also apply for the prestigious FIRST Chairman's Award. For the 2021-2022 season, I have a leadership position as the Design Lead for the non-technical subteam. I am also Vice President of EBHS's Anime Club, as well as a member of French Honors Society and Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA).
* **Academics:** On my SAT, I managed to get a score of 1510 on my first attempt in December 2020. At Rutgers Model Congress in the 2018-2019 school year, I won the award for Most Improved Delegate for my committee. I received a Letter of Commendation for the PSAT from the National Merit Scholarship Program in 2022.
* **Hobbies:** I have been doing graphic design for 4 years. This has culminated with the design for the robotics team's logo, website, merchandise, etc. I also enjoy photography, which I mostly do casually but have done photo and video work for EBFI. I often spend vacations hiking, especially at various National and State Parks around the country.
